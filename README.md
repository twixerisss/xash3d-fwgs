Xash3D ([pronounced](https://ipa-reader.com/?text=ks%C9%91%CA%82) `[ksɑʂ]`) FWGS is a game engine, aimed to provide compatibility with Half-Life Engine and extend it, as well as to give game developers well known workflow. This is the Wii/Gamecube port of the engine

Xash3D FWGS is a heavily modified fork of an original [Xash3D Engine](https://www.moddb.com/engines/xash3d-engine) by Unkle Mike.

## Installation & Running

**New to this? Read [Documentation/wii-setup.md](Documentation/wii-setup.md)** -
a step-by-step guide covering the SD card layout, the two things a PC copy of
Half-Life gets wrong, the controls, and what does and does not work yet. The
short version follows.


0) Rename `xash.dol` to `boot.dol` if it was compiled
1) Move the `boot.dol` file to some directory inside the `apps` folder
2) Copy `valve` directory to a folder named `xash3d` in the root of the sd card
3) Run it via the Homebrew Channel

## Controls

Three controllers are supported. Everything below is rebindable from
Options -> Controls, where the buttons show up under their engine names.

### Wii remote + nunchuk

A nunchuk is required for this scheme: the stick is how you move.

| Button | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **B** (trigger) | Fire |
| **A** | Jump |
| **Nunchuk C** | Use / interact, and reload |
| **Nunchuk Z** | Crouch |
| **1** | Flashlight |
| **2** | Secondary fire |
| **D-pad up** | Reload |
| **D-pad down** | Last weapon used |
| **D-pad left / right** | Previous / next weapon |
| **-** | Walk (hold) |
| **+** | Pause |
| **Home** | Menu |

Aiming uses the remote's pointer. Point near the middle of the screen and only
the weapon moves, which keeps fine aiming steady; point towards an edge and the
view turns, faster the further out you go. Shots follow the pointer rather than
the camera.

### Classic controller

| Button | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **R** | Fire |
| **ZR** | Secondary fire |
| **L** | Crouch |
| **ZL** | Walk (hold) |
| **a** | Jump |
| **b** | Use / interact |
| **x** | Reload |
| **y** | Flashlight |
| **D-pad left / right** | Previous / next weapon |
| **D-pad down** | Last weapon used |
| **+** | Pause |
| **Home** | Menu |

Left stick moves, right stick looks. There is no pointer aiming on this
scheme, so `wii_ir 0` is worth setting if you use it exclusively.

### GameCube controller

| Button | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **R** | Fire |
| **Z** | Secondary fire |
| **L** | Crouch |
| **A** | Jump |
| **B** | Use / interact |
| **X** | Reload |
| **Y** | Flashlight |
| **D-pad left / right** | Previous / next weapon |
| **D-pad down** | Last weapon used |
| **Start** | Menu |

Left stick moves, C-stick looks.

Which scheme is active is decided from what is plugged in, so a classic
controller and a GameCube pad can both be connected without fighting each
other. `wii_buttons 0` turns the direct reading off and falls back to whatever
SDL makes of the controller.

The menu plays `media/gamestartup.mp3`. Steam installs ship the soundtrack as
`media/Half-Life01.mp3` and up, with no `gamestartup.mp3` at all, so the menu
comes up silent until you copy one of them to that name.

## Build instructions
The Wii/GC port currently uses cmake to build its binaries. Will integrate it into waf at some point

**NOTE: NEVER USE GitHub's ZIP ARCHIVES. GitHub doesn't include external dependencies we're using!**

### Prerequisites

*  Install CMake
*  Install [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started)
*  Install devkitPPC and the needed libraries
 `sudo (dkp-)pacman -S wii-dev wii-sdl2 wii-opengx ppc-bzip2 ppc-freetype ppc-zlib`
*  Create a development directory
*  Clone the following repositories in the same directory
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/twixerisss/xash3d-fwgs
git clone --recursive https://github.com/twixerisss/mainui_cpp
git clone --recursive https://github.com/twixerisss/hlsdk-portable
```

### Building
1) Configure build `cmake -S. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="/opt/devkitpro/cmake/Wii.cmake"`
2) Compile `make -C build`

Or just `./build_wii.sh`, which wraps both steps and picks up devkitPro from
`$DEVKITPRO`. On CMake 4 the configure step additionally needs
`-DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5`, because the vendored opus still declares
a pre-3.5 minimum; the helper script passes it for you.

This will build:
- the filesystem
-  hlsdk (game libraries)
-  mainui
-  the engine itself

### Build options

| option | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `XASH_RENDERER` | `soft` | `soft` for the software rasteriser, `gl` for ref_gl on opengx. Only one can be linked - both compile `ref/common` and both export `GetRefAPI`. |
| `XASH_LOW_MEMORY` | `2` | Engine memory profile. `0` currently crashes on map load - see below. It no longer affects the menu artwork, which is controlled separately by `ui_lowmemory`. |
| `XASH_OGC_TRACE` | `OFF` | Report model loads and texture uploads over the gecko. |

The heap lives in MEM2 (`MALLOC_MEM2` in `sys_ogc.c`). MEM1 holds the
executable, and a GL build leaves only a few MB of it - not enough to load a
map.

### Performance notes

The devkitPro toolchain puts `-O2 -DNDEBUG` on every target, but the `xash`
target used to append `-Og -g3 -fno-omit-frame-pointer`, and later flags win in
GCC. So the engine core, meaning the frame loop, the client, the server, model
and sound loading, was the only part of the build compiled unoptimised while
the renderer and game code were not.

That is fixed, and `engine/common/host.c` is no longer an exception. It was
pinned to `-Og` for a long time because switching it to `-O2` let the engine
come up while almost nothing reached the screen, a symptom matching
`Host_FilterTime` never returning true so `Host_Frame` bails before rendering.
Retested at `-O2` across the full map set and the hang does not return, so
whatever it depended on has been fixed since. If it ever comes back, that is
the first thing to suspect.

Measured on the c0a0 intro, counting dumped frames over a fixed wall-clock
window, software renderer:

| change | avg fps |
| --- | --- |
| 640x480, whole engine -Og | 25.3 |
| 320x240 | 47.2 |
| 320x240, engine -O2 except host.c | 49.8 |
| 320x240, everything -O2 | pin removed, worth about 5% |
| 320x240, 3D rendering disabled (ceiling) | 55.0 |

`vid_scale` is not the way to lower the render resolution, `ref_soft` does
not implement it and silently ignores the request. Change the video mode
(`width`/`height`) instead. 512x384 is not a real mode here and falls back to
640x480.

### Frame pacing

Both renderers wait for vsync before presenting, so the console's refresh rate
is the frame rate ceiling: 60fps on a 60Hz console, 50fps on a 50Hz PAL mode.
The GPU renderer goes through `SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval`, and the software
renderer through `SDL_OGC_UpdateWindowFramebuffer`, which asks the flip to
wait. The engine prints the mode it found at startup.

`fps_max` defaults to 60 and is a fallback, not the pacing. `Host_CalcFPS`
returns zero in single player whenever `gl_vsync` is set, which skips the
software cap entirely, so `fps_max` only takes over once vsync is off.

Default resolution is per renderer: 640x480 for the GPU, 320x240 for the
software rasteriser, since resolution costs the CPU renderer far more.

### Known limits

`XASH_LOW_MEMORY=0` crashes on map load with a NULL callback in libogc's tick
task. The menu artwork no longer depends on it, `ui_lowmemory` controls that
on its own, so profile 0 is now only about the engine's own limits.

An engine error on real hardware is still under investigation. The error
itself is not identified; what is known is that the red exception screen
players used to see was the shutdown crashing after the error, not the error.
`sd:/xash3d/engine.log` now carries the reason.

### Debugging

The Wii has nowhere to print to, so the engine can route stdout to a USB Gecko
in memory card slot B (`-DXASH_OGC_GECKO=1`, on by default in this tree). That
covers everything from the first line of `main()` onwards, which is where the
interesting crashes still are.

Dolphin emulates the gecko as a TCP socket, so a headless boot can be captured
end to end:

```
./test_wii.sh [seconds]
```

It launches Dolphin in batch mode with a USB Gecko in slot B, attaches to the
socket and prints the engine's trace. It reads the SD image from
`~/Library/Application Support/Dolphin/Load/WiiSD.raw` (Dolphin ignores
`WiiSDCardPath`), which needs `xash3d/valve` in its root - the same layout as a
real card. `SDIMG=`, `DOL=` and `DOLPHIN=` override the paths.

To drive it without input, put commands in `valve/userconfig.cfg` on the card -
it is exec'd last, after the menu is up, so `map c0a0` boots straight into the
game. Dolphin can capture what that looks like with
`-C Dolphin.Movie.DumpFrames=True`, which writes PNGs to `<userdir>/Dump/Frames`.

Note that Dolphin's SD emulation is roughly a thousand times slower than real
hardware - every read is a full emulated IOS round trip - so booting under the
emulator takes minutes where a real Wii takes seconds. Don't optimise for it.
